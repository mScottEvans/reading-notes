## Java Imports (ignore the parts about NetBeans)

Imports are the next building block of Java programming that is essential to master in order to write advanced programs. Java gives you the advantage of pre-built classes and methods that can perform many functions such as reading a content file or comparing different dates. The classes are organized into packages that must be imported into your project in order to be used. 
Import statement in Java is helpful to take a class or all classes visible for a program specified under a package, with the help of a single statement. It is pretty beneficial as the programmer do not require to write the entire class definition. Hence, it improves the readability of the program. 

## Different types of loops in Java
In Java, there are three kinds of loops which are â€“ the for loop, the while loop, and the do-while loop. All these three loop constructs of Java executes a set of repeated statements as long as a specified condition remains true.
Every loop has its elements or variables that govern its execution. Generally, a loop has four elements that have different purposes which are:

Initialization Expression(s)
Test Expression(Condition)
Update Expression(s)
Body of the loop
