Binary, Decimal and Hexadecimal Numbers
You want to display an integer as a series of bits, for example when interacting with certain hardware devices. You want to convert a binary number or a hexadecimal value into an integer.

Integer.valueOf( ) is more general than binary formatting. It will also convert a string number from any radix to int, just by changing the second argument. Octal is base 8, decimal is 10, hexadecimal 16. Going the other way, the Integer class includes toBinaryString( ) , toOctalString( ), and toHexString( ).
