Read: Stacks & Queues

A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed in a fashion. The name “stack” is derived from a stack of plates. So, when we need a plate, we take (pop) from the top of the stack and when we want to add a plate we put (push) it at the top as well. We cannot add or remove a plate at the middle of the stack.

In a like manner, elements can be added to the stack at the top and they can be seen or removed from the top. No element can be retrived, removed, or added from the middle of the stack.

Stack is a fundamental data structure. They are used in many applications. One such application is undo mechanism in text editors. All the changes are stored in a stack. When you undo something, it pops the most recent action. When you make changes, it pushes changes onto the stack.

You must have also observed the Back and Forward buttons on browsers. These are also performed using stacks.
