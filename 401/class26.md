Android fundamentals

Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages. The Android SDK tools compile your code along with any data and resource files into an APK or an Android App Bundle.

An Android package, which is an archive file with an .apk suffix, contains the contents of an Android app that are required at runtime and it is the file that Android-powered devices use to install the app.

An Android App Bundle, which is an archive file with an .aab suffix, contains the contents of an Android app project including some additional metadata that is not required at runtime. An AAB is a publishing format and is not installable on Android devices, it defers APK generation and signing to a later stage. When distributing your app through Google Play for example, Google Play's servers generate optimized APKs that contain only the resources and code that are required by a particular device that is requesting installation of the app.

Each Android app lives in its own security sandbox, protected by the following Android security features:

The Android operating system is a multi-user Linux system in which each app is a different user.
By default, the system assigns each app a unique Linux user ID (the ID is used only by the system and is unknown to the app). The system sets permissions for all the files in an app so that only the user ID assigned to that app can access them.
Each process has its own virtual machine (VM), so an app's code runs in isolation from other apps.
By default, every app runs in its own Linux process. The Android system starts the process when any of the app's components need to be executed, and then shuts down the process when it's no longer needed or when the system must recover memory for other apps.
The Android system implements the principle of least privilege. That is, each app, by default, has access only to the components that it requires to do its work and no more. This creates a very secure environment in which an app cannot access parts of the system for which it is not given permission. However, there are ways for an app to share data with other apps and for an app to access system services:

It's possible to arrange for two apps to share the same Linux user ID, in which case they are able to access each other's files. To conserve system resources, apps with the same user ID can also arrange to run in the same Linux process and share the same VM. The apps must also be signed with the same certificate.
An app can request permission to access device data such as the device's location, camera, and Bluetooth connection. The user has to explicitly grant these permissions. For more information, see Working with System Permissions.
