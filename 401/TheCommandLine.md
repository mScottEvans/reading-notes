The Command Line

The window, which is usually called the command line or command-line interface, is a text-based application for viewing, handling, and manipulating files on your computer. It's much like Windows Explorer or Finder on the Mac, but without the graphical interface. Other names for the command line are: cmd, CLI, prompt, console or terminal. 

While the terminal may seem mysterious and intimidating at first, it's easy to learn once you realize that a terminal uses the same information as all of your usual applications. There are direct analogs for everything you do in a GUI to most of the everyday activities you do in a terminal. So instead of starting your journey with the shell by learning terminal commands, begin with everyday tasks that you're already familiar with.

In order to manage all those files in an orderly fashion, man likes to think of them in an ordered tree-like structure on the hard disk, as we know from MS-DOS (Disk Operating System) for instance. The large branches contain more branches, and the branches at the end contain the tree's leaves or normal files. For now we will use this image of the tree, but we will find out later why this is not a fully accurate image.

What i've learn is about The Linux Commands Handbook this handbook does not try to cover everything under the sun related to Linux and its commands. It focuses on the small core commands that you will use the 80% or 90% of the time, and tries to simplify the usage of the more complex ones.

## File Manipulation- 
Like so many Linux features, you have a variety of options from which to choose when you want to manipulate files and directories. You can also use wildcards when you're copying, moving, or deleting files and directories.
the copy command is typing:

cp <source> <destination>

-To move files, use the mv command (man mv), which is similar to the cp command, except that with mv the file is physically moved from one place to another, instead of being duplicated, as with cp.
-When you copy or move files, you can also rename.
-To copy the file sneakers.txt from our login directory to our tigger subdirectory, just type:
cp sneakers.txt tigger

Sometimes when learning a new language it’s handy to have a cheat sheet as you are getting used to syntax. After you’ve learned the language, it’s always nice to have a quick reference to refer to when using less common idioms. There are plenty of cheat sheets you can get for all langugues you are trying to learn and i thought that was a very much a 'Ah-haa!' moment.
