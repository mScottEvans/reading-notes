Primitives vs. Objects
A primitive is a data type that is composed of no other data types and can not be broken down any further. It is like the atoms in the programming scenario. I say atom because atom is a basic unit of matter and there is nothing that can be derived from it.

Exceptions in Java (read the first three sections on the left: What is an Exception, The Catch or Specify Requirement, Catching and Handling Exceptions)
Primitive cannot divided any more like int, string (such as built-in data type) . On the other way, object can divide into small pieces like array, structure.

Using Scanner to read in a file in Java
The scanner provides methods like hasNextLine() and readNextLine() which can be used to read file line by line. It's advised to check for next line before reading next the line to avoid NoSuchElementException in Java.  

Ex.) 
import java.io.File;
import java.io.FileNotFoundException;
import java.util.Scanner;
