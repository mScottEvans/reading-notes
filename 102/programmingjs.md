## Control Flow

The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line. A typical script in JavaScript or PHP (and the like) includes many control structures, including conditionals, loops and functions. Parts of a script may also be set to execute when events occur.
