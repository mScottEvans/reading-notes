# What is CSS

CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, includinglayout, colors, and fonts. CSS has a simple syntax and uses a number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. The style definitions are normally saved in external .css files. With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

## What is CSS for?

CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users this will include things like styling, layouts, etc. CSS can be used for very basic document text styling. Changing the color and size of headings and links, it can be used to create layout just like turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. Have a look at the links in this paragraph for specific examples.

## How to Add CSS

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:


### External CSS
With an external stylesheet file, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file! An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

### Internal CSS 
An internal style sheet may be used if one single HTML page has a unique style. The internal style is defined inside the "style" "element", inside the head section.

### Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element. To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
