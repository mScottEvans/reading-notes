# Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)
An unordered list is simply a list of related items whose order does not matter. Creating an unordered list in HTML is accomplished using the unordered list block-level element, <ul>. Each item within an unordered list is individually marked up using the list item element, <li>.

The ordered list element, <ol>, works very much like the unordered list element; individual list items are created in the same manner. The main difference between an ordered list and an unordered list is that with an ordered list, the order in which items are presented is important.

Creating a description list in HTML is accomplished using the description list block-level element, <dl>. Instead of using a <li> element to mark up list items, the description list requires two block-level elements: the description term element, <dt>, and the description element, <dd>.


# Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)
If a box has an outer display type of block, it will behave in the following ways:

The box will break onto a new line.
The box will extend in the inline direction to fill the space available in its container. In most cases this means that the box will become as wide as its container, filling up 100% of the space available.
The width and height properties are respected.
Padding, margin and border will cause other elements to be pushed away from the box

# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
This chapter compares number and string values, and explains how decision making is implemented in JavaScript and how one can use it to make the code smarter. In JavaScript, the flow of the code's execution can be changed depending on whether a condition is true or false, using an ’if’ statement or a switch statement. The chapter introduces some new operators that are essential for the definition of conditions.
