The <a> tag is what makes hypertext "hyper." With it, you can create clickable links between pages, as well as links to specific anchor points on any page. This hour focused on creating simple links to other pages using either relative or absolute addressing to identify the pages.

#Chapter 3 (first part): “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)

An object is a collection of related data and/or functionality. These usually consist of several variables and functions (which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects). Let's work through an example to understand what they look like.

Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output. To use a function, you must define it somewhere in the scope from which you wish to call it.


#Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”

As we know from the chapter Data types, there are eight data types in JavaScript. Seven of them are called “primitive”, because their values contain only a single thing (be it a string or a number or whatever).

In contrast, objects are used to store keyed collections of various data and more complex entities. In JavaScript, objects penetrate almost every aspect of the language. So we must understand them first before going in-depth anywhere else.
