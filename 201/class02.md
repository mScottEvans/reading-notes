## The DOCTYPE
A DOCTYPE declaration must be specified on the first line of each web document: The DOCTYPE tells the web browser which version of HTML the page is written in.
The <html> Element, The <html> element tells the browser that the page will be formatted in HTML and, optionally, which world language the page content is in.
The <head> element surrounds all the special “behind the scenes” elements of a web document.  Most of these elements do not get displayed directly on the web page.
The <body> element surrounds all the actual content (text, images, videos, links, etc.) that will be displayed on our web page.

# Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.53-84)
  JavaScript is a multi-paradigm, dynamic language with types and operators, standard built-in objects, and methods. Its syntax is based on the Java and C languages — many structures from those languages apply to JavaScript as well. JavaScript supports object-oriented programming with object prototypes, instead of classes (see more about prototypical inheritance and ES2015 classes). JavaScript also supports functional programming — because they are objects, functions may be stored in variables and passed around like any other object.


# Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)
This chapter compares number and string values, and explains how decision making is implemented in JavaScript and how one can use it to make the code smarter. In JavaScript, the flow of the code's execution can be changed depending on whether a condition is true or false, using an ’if’ statement or a switch statement. The chapter introduces some new operators that are essential for the definition of conditions. Comparison operators have a left-hand side (LHS) and a right-hand side (RHS). The ’if’ statement is used in almost every program that is more than a couple of lines long. The while loop is useful for looping through some code for as long as a test condition remains true. The ’do … while’ loop executes the code once and then keeps executing the code as long as the test condition remains true.
