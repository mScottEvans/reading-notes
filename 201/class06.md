## Chapter 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)

### Internally, when a property of an object literal only has a name, the JavaScript engine searches for a variable with the same name in the surrounding scope. If the JavaScript engine can find one, it assigns the property the value of the variable.

## Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)

### The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
