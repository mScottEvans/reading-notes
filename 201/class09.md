## Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)

### A large part of developing a web based application involves handling interaction with user via their web browsers. One of the most common tasks in this area of web development involves presenting the user with forms to collect information, and then processing that information.

## Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)

The HTML table model allows authors to arrange data -- text, preformatted text, images, links, forms, form fields, other tables, etc. -- into rows and columns of cells





## Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)

### In addition to the usual events supported by HTML elements, the details> element supports the toggle event, which is dispatched to the details> element whenever its state changes between open and closed. It is sent after the state is changed, although if the state changes multiple times before the browser can dispatch the event, the events are coalesced so that only one is sent.
