# Readings: React and Forms

## What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
 A component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the component's state.

## Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
As soon as they enter them so that it can be updated for future purpose.

## How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
We would just apply the event listener on there



## Why would we use a ternary operator?
A ternary operator allows you to assign one value to the variable if the condition is true, and another value if the condition is false.


## Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

### if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

ternary statement:
console.log((x===y)? "true" : "false");
