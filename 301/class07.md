Who is Roy Fielding?

Roy Thomas Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.




Why don’t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?

The ways that we communicate with our machines, and the ways that our machines communicate with us, are essential to the quality of our overall user experience. This has never been more true than with artificial intelligence. The enhanced power of AI-infused software relies on not just the correct data getting from us to the machine, but then on the machine’s sophistication interpreting it.

What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?

HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is the foundation of any data exchange on the Web and it is a client-server protocol, which means requests are initiated by the recipient, usually the Web browser. 




What does a GET do?

It means the function is a getter for a property.




What does a POST do?

POST you can have 2 requests coming in at the same time making modifications to a URL, and they may update different parts of the object




What does PUT do?

PUT is defined to assume idempotency, so if you PUT an object twice, it should have no additional effect. This is a nice property, so I would use PUT when possible. Just make sure that the PUT-idempotency actually is implemented correctly in the server.




What does PATCH do?
