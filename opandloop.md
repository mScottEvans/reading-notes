# Operators 
There are many types of operators in JavaScript.
- Assignment operators
An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.
- Comparison operators
A comparison operator compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true.
- Arithmetic operators
 An arithmetic operator takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value.
- Bitwise operators
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. 
- Logical operators
Logical operators are typically used with Boolean (logical) values; when they are, they return a Boolean value.
- String operators
In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.
- Conditional operator
The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. The operator can have one of two values based on a condition.
- Comma operator
The comma operator (,) evaluates both of its operands and returns the value of the last operand.
- Unary operators
A unary operation is an operation with only one operand
- Relational operators
A relational operator compares its operands and returns a Boolean value based on whether the comparison is true.



# Loops
There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they repeat an action some number of times. Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly. The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop. There are various situations that are more easily served by one type of loop over the others.
